At a low level, the\n * camera provides a methods for converting between a map's coordinate system\n * to display pixel coordinates.\n *\n * For the moment, all camera transforms are assumed to be expressible as\n * 4x4 matrices.  More general cameras may follow that break this assumption.\n *\n * The interface for the camera is relatively stable for \"map-like\" views,\n * e.g. when the camera is pointing in the direction [0, 0, -1], and placed\n * above the z=0 plane.  More general view changes and events have not yet\n * been defined.\n *\n * The camera emits the following events when the view changes:\n *\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.pan} when the camera is translated in the\n *       x/y plane\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.zoom} when the camera is changed in a way\n *       that modifies the current zoom level\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.view} when the visible bounds change for\n *       any reason\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.projection} when the projection type changes\n *   * {@link geo.event.camera.viewport} when the viewport changes\n *\n * By convention, protected methods do not update the internal matrix state,\n * public methods do.  There are a few primary methods that are intended to\n * be used by external classes to mutate the internal state:\n *\n *   * bounds: Set the visible bounds (for initialization and zooming)\n *   * pan: Translate the camera in x/y by an offset (for panning)\n *   * viewFromCenterSizeRotation: set the camera view based on a center\n *        point, boundary size, and rotation angle.\n *\n * @class\n * @alias geo.camera\n * @extends geo.object\n * @param {object?} spec Options argument\n * @param {string} spec.projection One of the supported\n *    {@link geo.camera.projection}.\n * @param {object} spec.viewport The initial camera viewport\n * @param {object} spec.viewport.width\n * @param {object} spec.viewport.height\n * @returns {geo.camera}\n */\nvar camera = function (spec) {\n  if (!(this instanceof camera)) {\n    return new camera(spec);\n  }\n\n  var geo_event = require('./event');\n\n  spec = spec || {};\n  object.call(this, spec);\n\n  /**\n   * The view matrix\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._view = util.mat4AsArray();\n\n  /**\n   * The projection matrix\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._proj = util.mat4AsArray();\n\n  /**\n   * The projection type (one of `this.constructor.projection`)\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._projection = null;\n\n  /**\n   * The transform matrix (view * proj)\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._transform = util.mat4AsArray();\n\n  /**\n   * The inverse transform matrix (view * proj)^-1\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._inverse = util.mat4AsArray();\n\n  /**\n   * Cached bounds object recomputed on demand.\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._bounds = null;\n\n  /**\n   * Cached \"display\" matrix recomputed on demand.\n   * @see {@link geo.camera.display}\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._display = null;\n\n  /**\n   * Cached \"world\" matrix recomputed on demand.\n   * @see {@link geo.camera.world}\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._world = null;\n\n  /**\n   * The viewport parameters size and offset.\n   * @property {number} height Viewport height in pixels\n   * @property {number} width Viewport width in pixels\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._viewport = {width: 1, height: 1};\n\n  /**\n   * Set up the projection matrix for the current projection type.\n   * @protected\n   */\n  this._createProj = function () {\n    var func = this._projection === 'perspective' ? mat4.frustum : mat4.ortho,\n        clipbounds = this._clipbounds[this._projection];\n    func(this._proj, clipbounds.left, clipbounds.right, clipbounds.bottom,\n         clipbounds.top, clipbounds.near, clipbounds.far);\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Update the internal state of the camera on change to camera\n   * parameters.\n   * @protected\n   * @fires geo.event.camera.view\n   */\n  this._update = function () {\n    this._bounds = null;\n    this._display = null;\n    this._world = null;\n    this._transform = mat4.multiply(util.mat4AsArray(), this._proj, this._view);\n    mat4.invert(this._inverse, this._transform);\n    this.geoTrigger(geo_event.camera.view, {\n      camera: this\n    });\n  };\n\n  /**\n   * Getter/setter for the view matrix.\n   * @note copies the matrix value on set.\n   * @property {mat4} view The view matrix.\n   * @name geo.camera#view\n   */\n  Object.defineProperty(this, 'view', {\n    get: function () {\n      return this._view;\n    },\n    set: function (view) {\n      mat4.copy(this._view, view);\n      this._update();\n    },\n    configurable: true\n  });\n\n  /**\n   * Getter/setter for the view bounds.\n   *\n   * @property {object} bounds The view bounds.\n   * @property {number} bounds.left\n   * @property {number} bounds.top\n   * @property {number} bounds.right\n   * @property {number} bounds.bottom\n   * @name geo.camera#bounds\n   */\n  Object.defineProperty(this, 'bounds', {\n    get: function () {\n      if (this._bounds === null) {\n        this._bounds = this._getBounds();\n      }\n      return this._bounds;\n    },\n    set: function (bounds) {\n      this._setBounds(bounds);\n      this._update();\n    }\n  });\n\n  /**\n   * Getter/setter for the render clipbounds.
